# Improving Issue Triage with Attached Screenshots

This project improves IssueTAG [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09846-3]([1]) with the use of screenshots attached to issue reports in our industrial case. It includes code on how we include textual and visual features extracted from the subject, description and screenshot attachments in our classification pipeline. 

Due to security and privacy reasons, we are able to publish (in full, or in partial) neither the issue reports used in these studies nor the scripts regarding the SVM_TA_2 model described in our paper. However, other scripts, which are similar to the ones we used in order to carry out the experiments for the issue assignment approach to include screenshot attachments, can be found in this repository. 

## IssueTAG

IssueTAG is a software issue report assignment tool, which has been fully operational in an industrial setting since Jan 12, 2018, making automated assignments for all the issue reports submitted [IssueTAG](https://github.com/ethemutku/IssueTAG) using the attached screenshots [1]. In this work, we show that we can improve its performance by using the screenshots attached to the issue reports. This repository includes the scripts which are similar to the ones we used in order to carry out the experiments.
