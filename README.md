# Improving Issue Triage with Attached Screenshots

This project improves IssueTAG **(Aktas and Yilmaz, 2020)** with the use of screenshots attached to issue reports in our industrial case. It includes code on how we extract the textual features in attached screenshots and how we include them in our classification pipeline. 

Due to security reasons, we are able to publish (in full, or in partial) neither the issue reports used in these studies nor the source code of IssueTAG. However, some scripts, which are similar to the ones we used in order to carry out the experiments for the issue assignment approach to include attached screenshots, can be found here. 

## IssueTAG

IssueTAG is a software issue report assignment tool, which has been fully operational in an industrial setting since Jan 12, 2018, making automated assignments for all the issue reports submitted (https://github.com/ethemutku/IssueTAG) using the attached screenshots. The paper is in progress, so the details other than the experimentation code will be available here soon.
